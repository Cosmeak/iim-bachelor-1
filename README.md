# Drezia - An esport team website

This website is a project for my first year final defense. The goal of this is to make our first website like a blog with **PHP**, **MySQL**, **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

Please don't use this project in production or other things, it contains a lot of security issues because it was made to learn.

No updates will be added to this project. This is a personal archive only.
