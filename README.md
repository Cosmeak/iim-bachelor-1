# Drezia - An esport team website

This website is a project for my first year final defense. The goal of this is to make our first website like a blog with **PHP**, **MySQL**, **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

Please don't use this project in production or other things, it contains a lot of security issues because it was made to learn but you can use the readme to make your own first website and learn with an objective.

No updates will be added to this project. This is a personal archive only.

| Creation of an image gallery with a lightbox system 	| + Add a filter system by theme or category to see only the corresponding images and create a masonry effect. 	|
| Create one or more interaction(s), which allows you to display or hide content on the site (Ex: accordion, toggle). The content to be displayed will come from an external site (twitch, youtube, twitter etc...) via iframes. Smooth animation is required. 	|  	|

### PHP

This part need to be integrated into the administration interface part.<br><br>On the side of the site's blog pages: a page will list all the articles with a featured image and an excerpt (beginning of the article). A click on a button or a link gives access to the entire article on another page. 	|


## Banned Things

Any use of one of these elements results is eliminatory and an automatic impossibility to integrate the web development bachelor.

- CMS (Wordpress, etc...)
- HTML and CSS code generate from a prototyping tool (adobe XD, Figma, etc...)
- Use a theme find on web (you have to start from scratch)
- Template Engine (Twig, PUG, etc...)
- Backend or Frontend framework
- Toolkits (Bootstrap, etc...)
